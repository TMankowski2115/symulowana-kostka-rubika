This project was developed using the Ursina library in Python. The main goal of the application is to create a graphical representation of a Rubik’s Cube and implement functions that allow the user to solve it, scramble it, and save the current state to a file.
A full description of the program’s functionality can be found in the file “Documentation describing the program structure.”
